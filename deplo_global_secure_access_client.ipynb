    "**‚úÖ Project 6 ‚Äì Deploy the Global Secure Access Client**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario**\n",
    "Your organization is transitioning to a Zero Trust architecture. To control user traffic at the identity layer‚Äîwithout relying on legacy VPN or perimeter devices‚Äîyou plan to deploy the **Global Secure Access (GSA) client** to enrolled Windows devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "This deployment enables **Entra Private Access (for internal LOB apps)** and **Entra Internet Access (for SaaS and M365 traffic)**, allowing Conditional Access policies to enforce decisions based on traffic direction, identity, and device compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GSA client is required for all downstream configurations and policy enforcement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-Step Action Flow (Simulated)**\n",
    "1. Go to Microsoft Intune Admin Center\n",
    "Navigate to:\n",
    "Microsoft Intune ‚Üí Devices ‚Üí Configuration profiles\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Create a new profile for GSA**\n",
    "Click + Create profile\n",
    "Platform: Windows 10 and later\n",
    "Profile type: Settings catalog\n",
    "Name: Deploy GSA Client ‚Äì Corp Devices\n",
    "Click Next\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Configure GSA client installation setting**\n",
    "Search catalog for: Global Secure Access\n",
    "Enable:\n",
    "Install the Microsoft Global Secure Access client ‚Üí Enabled\n",
    "Click Next ‚Üí Assign the profile to the device group containing your corporate Windows endpoints\n",
    "(e.g., group name: Windows ‚Äì Corp Devices)\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Confirm installation on endpoints**\n",
    "After the policy syncs, validate:\n",
    "A background service gsa.exe is running\n",
    "The system tray displays the GSA client icon\n",
    "Client registration succeeded (visible in GSA Admin Portal ‚Üí Devices)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Terminology Clarification**\n",
    "**Term**\t                      **Clarified Definition**\n",
    "**Global Secure Access (GSA)**\tMicrosoft's modern traffic control plane. It routes user traffic via Microsoft‚Äôs edge and enforces identity-aware policies. GSA is a container for two services: Private Access and Internet Access.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GSA Client**\tAn endpoint agent required for routing traffic through GSA. Similar to a VPN agent, but policy-aware and linked to Entra identity and device posture.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Private Access**\tSecures access to internal apps (e.g., line-of-business apps hosted in corp datacenters or private cloud) without exposing them to the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Internet Access**\tEnforces traffic control and Conditional Access for external SaaS or M365 apps. Used to prevent unmanaged devices from accessing unmanaged tenants.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forwarding Profile**\tA routing rule that determines which traffic (e.g., based on FQDN-Fully Qualified Domain Name), IP) is sent through the GSA agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**‚ö† Important Distinction:**\n",
    "**Installing the client does nothing on its own‚Äîuntil a forwarding profile and access policy are configured (see Projects 7‚Äì10). This step simply lays the foundation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result**\n",
    "**All assigned Windows devices now have the GSA client installed and ready to receive routing and enforcement policies from the GSA control plane. Traffic routing is not active until subsequent configurations are made.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Entra Control Stack Mapping**\n",
    "**Layer**\t     **Status**\t     **Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 1 ‚Äì Authority Definition**\t‚úÖ Touched\tRequires Intune Role permissions to deploy configuration profiles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 2 ‚Äì Scope Boundaries**\t‚úÖ Defined\tScope is applied via device groups; different departments/regions can have different routing assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 3 ‚Äì Test Identity Validation**\t‚úÖ Confirmed\tClient installation validated; user sign-in triggers registration with GSA backend\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 4 ‚Äì External Entry Controls**\t‚ùå Not Yet Applied\tNo B2B traffic or external access is controlled yet\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 5 ‚Äì Privilege Channels**\t‚úÖ Structured\tDevice configuration is delivered through Intune as trusted pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 6 ‚Äì Device Trust Enforcement**\t‚úÖ Initiated\tClient lays groundwork for enforcing traffic rules based on device state\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 7 ‚Äì Continuous Verification**\t‚úÖ Supported\tLogs from GSA and Intune provide traceability, and client status can be monitored continuously\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observations and Follow-Up**\n",
    "\n",
    "The GSA client enables real-time session enforcement for traffic direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without proper forwarding profiles and access policies, the client has no effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later projects will define traffic routing (Private vs. Internet) and policy enforcement (Conditional Access).\n",
    "\n",
    "Device groups must be well-managed to avoid over-provisioning the GSA client to unintended devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommend integrating with device compliance signals (via Intune or Defender) to strengthen enforcement.\n",
